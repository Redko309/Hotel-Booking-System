# Hotel-Booking-System
This is a simple hotel room booking system built using Flask and SQLite. The project allows users to view available rooms, make reservations, and manage bookings through a clean and intuitive interface. It was customized and adapted by me for learning purposes, with improvements in design and features to better reflect a real-world scenario.
